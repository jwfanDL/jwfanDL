Jiawei Fan works for Intel Labs China <img src='images/intel.jpg' style='width: 2.5em;'> as an AI researcher, supervised by <a href='https://yaoanbang.github.io/'>Anbang Yao</a>. He aims to construct a novel distillation method to contribute to omni-scale high-performance intelligent vision systems. Previously, he was an intern at MEGVII and obtained the Outstanding Intern award as he designed a high-performance parameter-free regularization method for action recognition.

He obtained master degree of computer science in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), supervised by <a href='https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/songmeina/zh_CN/'>Meina Song</a>. Before that, he obtained **first-class honorable degree** of Bachelor of Science and Engineering. when he graduated from joint program of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL).

[ScaleKD: Strong Vision Transformer Could Be Excellent Teachers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06786)

**Jiawei Fan**, Chao Li, Xiaolong Liu, Anbang Yao\#

[**Code**](https://github.com/deep-optimization/ScaleKD) **|** [**Project**](https://deep-optimization.github.io/scalekd/)
- It is the first work to explore how to transfer the scalable property of pre-trained large vision transformer models to smaller target models.
- ScaleKD could be used as a more efficient alternative to the time-intensive pre-training paradigm for any target student model on large-scale datasets.

Jiawei Fan works for Intel Labs China <img src='images/intel.jpg' style='width: 2.5em;'> as an AI researcher, supervised by <a href='https://yaoanbang.github.io/'>Anbang Yao</a>. He aims to construct a novel distillation method to contribute to omni-scale high-performance intelligent vision systems. Previously, he was an intern at MEGVII and obtained the outstanding intern award as he designed a high-performance parameter-free regularization method for action recognition.

He obtained master degree of computer science in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), supervised by <a href='https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/songmeina/zh_CN/'>Meina Song</a>. Before that, he obtained **first-class honorable degree** of Bachelor of Science and Engineering. when he graduated from joint programme of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL).
